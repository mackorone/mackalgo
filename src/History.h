    // The History class is a circular stack that remembers the previous

    // whenever new wall info has been learned, and to call move() whenever the
    // mouse moves from one cell to the next. However, you should call add() at
    // most once between calls to move(), and you should call move() at least
    // once between calls to add(). This is because the History class assumes
    // that, for every cell that the mouse travels, at most one cell's worth of
    // wall information can be learned.
